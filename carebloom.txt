## Inspiration

We wanted to build something that blends AI and empathy — a smart health companion that supports women during pregnancy by predicting potential risks early and sending timely alerts. The idea was to make healthcare more accessible and proactive using intelligent technology.

## What it does

CareBloom is an AI-powered health assistant that:

Takes user input to predict pregnancy risk (Low / Medium / High).

If the risk is High, it automatically activates Model B, which checks for Preeclampsia — a serious condition causing organ damage after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Displays both risk level and probability percentage for better clarity.

Allows users to enter a WhatsApp number and sends automatic alert messages to doctors, family members, or caretakers via Twilio WhatsApp API.

Uses Groq AI to provide personalized health advice based on the results.

## How we built it

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS (deployed on Vercel)

Backend: FastAPI(deployed on Render )

AI Models:

Model A – Predicts general pregnancy risk

Model B – Detects Preeclampsia risk and probability

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

APIs: Twilio WhatsApp API (alerts), Groq API (AI health advice)


## Challenges we ran into

Creating a multi-model prediction pipeline that activates dynamically

Deploying and connecting FastAPI backend with React frontend

Managing Twilio authentication and WhatsApp message delivery

Generating realistic AI health advice while maintaining accuracy and clarity

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Built a dual-model AI system that predicts both general and specific pregnancy risks

Successfully integrated real-time WhatsApp alerts and AI-based guidance

Designed a clean and user-friendly interface for effortless interaction

Deployed a fully functional end-to-end AI healthcare web app

## What we learned

Building connected AI systems with FastAPI and React

Integrating multiple models within one prediction pipeline

Handling API-based automation (Twilio, Groq)


## What's next for CareBloom

Expanding detection to include gestational diabetes and anemia

Creating a mobile app version for easier access

Enhancing AI advice with medical language models
